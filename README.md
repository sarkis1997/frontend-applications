## What is this project about?
This project is about to get more attention of younger people for the NMVW.

### but how?
I had the idea to create a 'social media' lookalike app where the user can scroll through.
The focus of the app is on slavery.
I wanted to give the users an idea and feeling of slavery by showing all kind of items that were related to slavery.
By showing the images, titles, descriptions and the periods of introduce I'll try to make a timeline in which the items will be showed from past to present. 
At the bottom of the page, there will be images showed of slavery during the period of that product to make an extra impression.

### How will it look?
This is a raw sketch of how the app will look like.
